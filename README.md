## ⚙️ AL2D's Companion Harmony Visualizer Tool
The JAR is built using Java 1.8, so it's compatible even with older Java versions, like your "dinosaur" version! :)

# 🌟Introduction

Greetings to those interested in this tool. This project is entirely free and represents my initial venture into the world of applications. It's also my first experience with GitHub, so please bear with any amateurish aspects.

# ℹ️ About

I've named this tool **Mount & Blade: Warband Companion-Harmony-Visualizer-Tool-by-AL2D** or, more concisely, **M&B/W:CHVT** or **W:CHVT**. It's an external Java application featuring a straightforward GUI.

# ✨Features

What you can expect from this tool:

- Select companions and receive color-coded relationship insights.
- Identify initial skills at a glance.
- Access helpful explanations.
- Utilize the 'Export' button to save your companion selections as a txt file.

# 🚫Limitations

What it won't do:

- Directly interact with your game or save files.

# 🔮 Future

Developing this tool was a personal challenge, and while I can't promise a stream of updates beyond version 1.0, I'll be vigilant about bug fixes. I may also consider creating a similar tool for Warband Mods (e.g Floris) or the first Mount and Blade game and Bannerlord. The future is uncertain.

Feel free to explore this tool at your own pace. 🛠️
