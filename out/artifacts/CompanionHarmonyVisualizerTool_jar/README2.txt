## JAR Versions - Base and Modern

This project provides two versions of the JAR file, each built with different Java versions. Here, I explain the differences between the "base" and "modern" versions to help you choose the one that suits your needs.

If unsure, choose Base Version

### Base Version

- **Built with Java 1.8**: The "base" version of the JAR is compiled using Java 1.8.

- **GUI May Look Dated**: The graphical user interface (GUI) of the "base" version may appear somewhat dated, as it adheres to the older Java 1.8 design standards.

- **May Not Be Optimized**: Given its reliance on an older Java version, the "base" version may not incorporate the latest performance optimizations.

- **Wide Compatibility**: The "base" version ensures broad compatibility as it is built on Java 1.8, which is commonly installed on systems. Most users who have played Minecraft will have this Java version readily available.

### Modern Version

- **Built with Oracle OpenJDK Java 19**: The "modern" version of the JAR is built using Oracle OpenJDK Java 19, which represents a more recent Java version.

- **Enhanced GUI**: The graphical user interface (GUI) in the "modern" version benefits from the design improvements and features introduced in Java 19, offering a more up-to-date appearance.

- **Potential Optimization**: Being built on a more recent Java version, the "modern" version may incorporate performance optimizations and benefits.

- **Compatibility Note**: Please be aware that users who do not have a modern Java version, specifically Java 19 or newer, installed on their systems may encounter compatibility issues when trying to run the "modern" version.

You can choose between the "base" and "modern" versions based on your preferences, system compatibility.
